# undertale-dialogues
Create Undertale style dialogues with Ren'Py.

## Documentation
Add the program to your directory in the Renpy Launcher, and then launch it. 


The only file you will need to change is `game->script.rpy`. 
Instructions on how to add characters and edit the script are both inside of the game and script.
